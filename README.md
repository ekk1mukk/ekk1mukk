### Heyy, I'm Ekki !

**I'm a student from Geneva, Switzerland. 🇨🇭**

**After learning and experimenting with web developement, Python, C#, SQL/NoSQL and multiple frameworks, I'm trying to get into lower-level programming as I would love to work with operating systems. Other fields of interest include cybersecurity and networking.**

**I'm also more and more embracing the open-source philosophy.**

**I currently speak *Français* and English.**

**You can find me on Twitter/X: [@ekkimukk11](https://twitter.com/ekkimukk11)**
